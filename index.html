                        River Kelvin is a 22-mile river that rises near Banton and flows west through Strathkelvin into the heart of Glasgow, where it joins the River Clyde. In the past, the river was used to power mills and was a source of water for various industries

                    <p class="raleway">
                        Several initiatives have aimed to clean up the River Kelvin, including a £15 million sewer upgrade by Scottish Water and ongoing litter picks by groups like Friends of the River Kelvin. Schools and local campaigns such as Upstream Battle® have also raised awareness about river pollution.

                    <p class="raleway"> Despite these efforts, litter such as plastic waste and flushed items remains a persistent problem, showing that cleanup work alone isn’t enough without wider cultural and systemic change.</p>

                                        The inadequate recycling systems along the River Kelvin struggle to process litter contaminated with sand and soap, resulting in most collected waste being sent to landfill.

                                        Low public awareness around the River Kelvin, especially among transient populations and some local residents, has led to a lack of understanding about the environmental impact of littering and pollution. This gap in knowledge contributes to irresponsible disposal behaviors, making it harder to protect and preserve the river’s ecosystem. Increasing education and community engagement is crucial to foster a stronger sense of environmental stewardship in the area.

                                        Limited support for conservation efforts along the River Kelvin, due to the absence of government financial backing, has resulted in a heavy reliance on volunteers and crowd-sourced funding. This lack of consistent funding poses challenges to sustaining long-term cleanup initiatives and implementing effective environmental programs, underscoring the need for increased institutional support to protect the river’s health.

                                        Ineffective communication channels hinder efforts to protect the River Kelvin, as there is no centralized information hub to coordinate activities and share updates. Reliance on word of mouth, Facebook, and Instagram limits the reach and engagement with a broader audience, reducing the overall impact of awareness campaigns and community involvement. Establishing more robust and centralized communication platforms is essential to enhance outreach and mobilize support effectively.

                                        Volunteer turnout along the River Kelvin typically ranges between 10 and 30 people per month, making it challenging to scale the impact of cleanup and conservation efforts. This limited participation restricts the ability to address the extent of environmental issues effectively, highlighting the need for strategies to boost volunteer engagement and broaden community involvement.

                                        A lack of resources hampers efforts to maintain and improve the River Kelvin’s environment, with no consistent financial backing and limited logistical support from the council. This scarcity of funds and assistance makes it difficult to organize large-scale initiatives, invest in necessary equipment, and sustain ongoing projects, emphasizing the need for stronger resource allocation and partnerships.

                                        Behavioral challenges persist along the River Kelvin, where many people continue to treat natural areas as dumping grounds. The prevalence of a takeaway culture and convenience-driven waste generation contributes significantly to littering, undermining efforts to keep the river and its surroundings clean. Addressing these attitudes through education and community initiatives is vital to fostering more responsible environmental behavior.

                                        Despite the availability of river sample data along the River Kelvin, this information remains largely underutilized. Although a few manufacturers are consistently identified as sources of litter, there is little follow-through or accountability to address these contributors. Leveraging this data more effectively could drive targeted actions and policies to reduce pollution and improve the river’s health.

                                        Awareness fatigue is a growing issue along the River Kelvin, where school programs and media coverage alone are insufficient to create lasting impact.

            <p class="raleway">
                We conducted a survey with 15 Glasgow residents to better understand the litter problem in their communities.
                The results provided valuable insight into behaviors, challenges, and motivations regarding littering and clean-up efforts.
            </p>
            <p class="raleway">
                Majority of respondents rated litter as a serious issue in their area, citing plastic bottles, food wrappers,
                and glass containers as the most common types. Encouragingly, 89% expressed interest in volunteering for clean-up
                activities, driven by environmental concern and a sense of community.

        <h2 class="bitter">📱 Mobile Application</h2>
        <p class="raleway">
            The mobile application is designed to support volunteers by offering a user-friendly interface where they can view upcoming litter pick-up events, receive notifications, and easily get involved in local environmental efforts. It streamlines communication and encourages greater participation, especially among new volunteers.

        <p class="raleway mb-3">
            This long-term initiative focuses on prevention through awareness. By collaborating with schools and leveraging social media platforms, we aim to educate young people about the impact of littering and promote sustainable habits early on. This not only cultivates environmental responsibility but fosters a lasting cultural shift.
