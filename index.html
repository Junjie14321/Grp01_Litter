                        River Kelvin is a 22-mile river that rises near Banton and flows west through Strathkelvin into the heart of Glasgow, where it joins the River Clyde. In the past, the river was used to power mills and was a source of water for various industries

                    <p class="raleway">
                        Several initiatives have aimed to clean up the River Kelvin, including a £15 million sewer upgrade by Scottish Water and ongoing litter picks by groups like Friends of the River Kelvin. Schools and local campaigns such as Upstream Battle® have also raised awareness about river pollution.
